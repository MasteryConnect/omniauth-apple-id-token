# OmniAuth::AppleIdToken

# WIP
_Note that this project is a work in progress and is not necessarily ready for production use at this time._

A [omnitauth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) strategy primarily used for validating Apple ID tokens
(JWT encoded) generated by Apple authentication servers. As with other Omniauth strategies, it can also
redirect to Apple's Sign In page.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'omniauth-apple-id-token'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-apple-id-token

## Usage

You use OmniAuth::Strategies::AppleIdToken just like you do any other OmniAuth strategy:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Strategies::AppleIdToken, aud_claim: 'com.example.app-name'
```

If this strategy is used primarily for validating a Apple ID token, then the only required fields are
aud_claim.
